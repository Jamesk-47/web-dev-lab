# web-dev-lab
James Katashila and Gift Mulenga

We first installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Git, a version control system, was installed to help track changes in code and collaboration. Node.js & npm (Node Package Manager) were installed for running JavaScript applications and managing packages.

We created a project folder (web-dev-lab) and built a simple HTML file (index.html) containing basic HTML structure (headings and paragraphs). The file was later opened in a web browser to view the webpage.

After configuring Git with personal details, we initialized a Git repository in the project folder to track changes. We then created a repository on GitHub, connected the local project to it, and pushed the changes to GitHub to ensure that the work is backed up and shareable online.
