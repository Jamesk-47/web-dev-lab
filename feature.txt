In this lab, we learned how to set up a web development environment by installing essential tools like VS Code, Git, and Node.js. we created a basic HTML webpage, practiced opening it in a browser, and explored version control using Git and GitHub. I also learned how to push my project to GitHub to track changes and collaborate. Overall, this lab helped me understand the tools and processes used in web development.
